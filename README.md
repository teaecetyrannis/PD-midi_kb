# PD-midi_kb
 Use your QWERTY keyboard as a MIDI keyboard!  
 (This patch was made in Purr Data but tested in Pd Vanilla and seemingly works just as fine)  
   
 This patch is pretty primitive: it currently allows multiple keypresses, switching octaves and setting the note velocity and channel.
 On default octave transposition (0) keys Z and Q are notes 48 and 60 (C3 and C4) then it just works as a regular piano (S is 49, X is 50, D is 51, C is 52, V is 53... and the same goes for the upper octave which extends a bit further up to the P key or note 76)  
 You can also easily switch between octaves with "numpad +" and "numpad -" keys.
   
 I hope this simple little patch is somehow useful to you!
